# USA-Diabetes-Prevalence-and-Cost-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the increasing prevalence of diabetes in the United States and the associated economic burden. By analyzing data from the CDC and a 2022 economic study, the project offers insights into diabetes rates across age, gender, and race, as well as the direct and indirect costs of managing the disease.

## Data Sources
- **Diabetes Prevalence**: Data from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html).
- **Economic Costs**: Based on Parker, E. D., Lin, J., et al. (2024). **Economic costs of diabetes in the US in 2022**.

## How to Access the Results
The final analysis and all the key insights are published on the project website, which can be accessed here: [Diabetes in US Analysis](https://sites.google.com/view/diabetes-in-us-analysis).
